* After preparing the data we need to preprocess that data so we require Feature Engineering.

**Feature Engineering**
Feature engineering refers to a process of selecting and transforming variables when creating a predictive model using machine learning or 
statistical modeling (such as deep learning, decision trees, or regression). The process involves a combination of data analysis.

**Why we use Feature Engineering technique**
Suppose if we build a model without Handling data, we got an accuracy of around 70%. By applying the Feature engineering on the same model 
there is a chance to increase the performance from 70% to more.
