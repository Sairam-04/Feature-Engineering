# Feature-Engineering

<h2> To perform particular Machine Learning Task we need to follow some steps.</h2>

- After preparing the data we need to preprocess that data so we require Feature Engineering.<br>

**Feature Engineering:** <br>
Feature engineering refers to a process of selecting and transforming variables when creating a predictive model using machine learning or <br>
statistical modeling (such as deep learning, decision trees, or regression). The process involves a combination of data analysis.<br>

**Why we use Feature Engineering technique:** <br>
Suppose if we build a model without Handling data, we got an accuracy of around 70%. By applying the Feature engineering on the same model <br>
there is a chance to increase the performance from 70% to more.<br>
